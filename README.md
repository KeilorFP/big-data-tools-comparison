  - Fault tolerance
  - Scalability
  - Cost-effective for large storage
- Typical use cases:
  - Scientific research
  - Automotive sensor data analysis

### üîπ Apache Spark
- Built around **Spark Core**
- Supports **Python, R, Java**
- Uses **in-memory** distributed processing (RDDs)
- Developed and maintained by **Databricks**
- Ideal for **real-time analytics and machine learning**
- Strengths:
  - Speed
  - Real-time processing
  - ML integrations
- Typical use cases:
  - Marketing & advertising
  - Predictive analytics in healthcare & e-commerce
